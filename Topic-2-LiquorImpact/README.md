# safeLiquor
A study to correlate the affect of liquor licenses issued, on the crime rate in the surrounding area, in an attempt
to regulate better patrolling and safer places to visit in a night

The analysis is submitted as part of our 'CSE544-Probability & Statistics for Data Science' coursework project which is built over
the dataset issued by NYPD Crime Complaints reported in recent years.
